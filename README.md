# Serverless Running Journal

Serverless app utilizing API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB to store simple text records of running journal entries (date, run distance, location, notes).

Functioning deployment of app can be used [here](https://main.d2wzbxb5oe0zlz.amplifyapp.com/).  The app is deployed as an AWS Amplify app conisting of minimal HTML pages demonstrating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. 

Terraform config for creating an AWS Amplify app to host static content of app included in this repository.  Terraform code for API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB and other infrastructure is in the 'infrastructure' directory.

After building the infrastructure, references to the API gateway URL must be updated in HTML and JS files to reference the new API Gateway URL generated by AWS.  CORS must be enabled for the API Gateway resource that writes to Lambda.  After CORS is enabled, the API must be deployed again in order for the changes to take effect and for API Gateway to properly invoke the Lambda function and write to the DynamoDB table.
